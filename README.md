## About Me

I am an economist and policy analyst with over three years of experience working at the intersection of trade, public finance, and program evaluation. My work focuses on applying quantitative and mixed-methods research to inform evidence-based policymaking, particularly in the areas of international trade, state finances, and development outcomes.

I have worked closely with national and state governments, multilateral organizations, and research institutions, contributing to flagship policy outputs and analytical frameworks used in high-level decision-making.
